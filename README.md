# PrimeChecker

This program uses the Miller-Rabin algorithm to test if a number is prime or not. 

The Miller-Rabin algorithm is a probibalistic test which means the more times it is performed, the more certain we can be of its primality.
This program performs it 9 times, which means the program will declare a composite number to be prime 1 in 262,144 times.
Though the program may declare a composite number to be prime, it will never declare a prime to be composite.

To use this tool, enter your number you want to test between the two triple ' after p = . Then run the program

GUI coming soon! I hope I'll eventually be able to make it into a mobile app.
